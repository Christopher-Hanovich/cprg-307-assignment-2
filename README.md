Assignment 2 of CPRG 307

For this assignment we are to edit the code in this repo to remove any errors and explain in the report document each of the errors and explain them as per the error explanation below.

When a syntax error is found do the following:

▪ A screenshot of the code section that contains the syntax error.
▪ A screenshot of the error message received from this syntax error.
▪ Written explanation identifying the reason for the syntax error (1 – 2 sentences).
▪ Written explanation identifying the correction to fix this syntax error (1 – 2 sentences).
▪ A screenshot of the code section that contains the corrected code.

When a logical error is found do the following:

▪ The expected result.
▪ The actual result.
▪ A screenshot of the code section that contains the logic error.
▪ Written explanation identifying the reason for the logic error (1 – 2
sentences).
▪ Written explanation identifying the correction to fix this logic error (1 – 2
sentences).
▪ A screenshot of the code section that contains the corrected code.

I have broken the code into the following sections to make the editting fair for each of us:

1) Lines 1-39
2) Lines 40 - 74
3) Lines 75 - 110
4) Lines 111 - 147

Before editing the document make sure to identify the errors, anyone may correct the whole code as required to identify errors but each person is only responsible for writing the errors found in their section as identified above.

If you edit the code please comment where any errors were found before you push and merge it.
